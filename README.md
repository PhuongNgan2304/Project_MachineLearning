<h1 align="center">Predicting Taxi Fare with LGBM Algorithm</h1>

<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

In this project, we tackle the challenge of predicting taxi fares in New York City using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset specific to NYC taxi rides, our goal is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates fares for different trip scenarios.

### Key Questions
1. What is the size of the New York City taxi fare dataset?
2. What features are included in the dataset?
3. Can you provide descriptions for each feature in the dataset?
4. How is missing or incomplete data handled in the dataset?
5. Have outliers or anomalies been addressed during data preprocessing?
6. How is the target variable, taxi fare, defined and measured?
7. Are there any categorical variables that require encoding?
8. What feature engineering techniques have been applied to enhance model performance?
9. Which evaluation metrics will be used to assess the predictive model's performance?
10. How will the dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets for model development?

### Answer
The New York City taxi fare prediction project utilizes a dataset comprising '>=55M row' records capturing various aspects of taxi rides within the city. Features in the dataset encompass crucial elements such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, time of day, day of the week, and potentially weather conditions or traffic density.

To ensure data quality, missing or incomplete data points are handled through appropriate imputation techniques or removal strategies during preprocessing. Outliers or anomalies are also addressed to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

The target variable, taxi fare, represents the monetary cost of the ride and is meticulously measured to reflect accurate fare estimations. Categorical variables are encoded as necessary to facilitate their inclusion in the predictive model.

Feature engineering techniques are employed to enrich the dataset and improve the model's predictive capabilities. These may include deriving new features from existing ones or transforming variables to better capture underlying patterns.

Evaluation of the predictive model's performance relies on metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE), ensuring an objective assessment of its accuracy.

The dataset is partitioned into training and testing sets using a suitable methodology, such as random sampling or time-based splitting, to validate the model's generalizability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
